</br> Menage, is founded in the year 2020 with the objective of  providing care to the people. Our main programmes include an orphanage and an old age home . "A home away from home " is our attempt to provide a homely and respectable living for the people with utmost commitment, dedication,trust and care.Our centre offers quality post acute and long term care.Our focus is providing exceptional services,by people who truly care in an environment that promotes healing and wellness. They are provided with free accommodation, medical expenses, and food. Elder people and children of any age are either referred by volunteers or sent by their relatives for admissions in our home. Many times they also apply themselves. Donations to this program help in covering the staff salary, medicines etc for the people living there. It also provides paid services for seniors who can afford them. The home also celebrates popular events and festivals to keep the spirit of the people. The old age home has all the facilities required for peaceful living. An in-house doctor and medical facilities take care of the healthcare requirements. With a strong belief that helping people and spreading awareness of e care would give them a new life. Each and every staff of Menage is well aware of the quality policy of the organization.</br>
